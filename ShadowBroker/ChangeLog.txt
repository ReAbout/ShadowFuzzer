- Fix default max_topic_alias listener config not being copied to the in-use
  listener when compiled without TLS support.
- Fix random number generation if compiling using `WITH_TLS=no` and on Linux

1.6.2 - 20190430
================

Broker:
- Fix memory access after free, leading to possible crash, when v5 client with
  Will message disconnects, where the Will message has as its first property

- Add TLS Engine support.
- Add support for ALPN on TLS connections. Closes #924.
- Add -D option for all clients to specify MQTT v5 properties.
- Add -E to mosquitto_sub, which causes it to exit immediately after having

  session without requiring a message to be received.
- Add --remove-retained to mosquitto_sub, which can be used to clear retained
  messages on a broker.

  output format. Closes #1220.


1.5.8 - 20190228
================

Broker:
- Fix clients being disconnected when ACLs are in use. This only affects the
  case where a client connects using a username, and the anonymous ACL list is
  defined but specific user ACLs are not defined. Closes #1162.
- Make error messages for missing config file clearer.
- Fix some Coverity Scan reported errors that could occur when the broker was
  already failing to start.

1.5.7 - 20190213
================

Broker:
- Fix build failure when using WITH_ADNS=yes
- Ensure that an error occurs if `per_listener_settings true` is given after
  other security options. Closes #1149.
- Fix include_dir not sorting config files before loading. This was partially
  fixed in 1.5 previously.
- Improve documentation around the `include_dir` option. Closes #1154.
- Fix case where old unreferenced msg_store messages were being saved to the
  persistence file, bloating its size unnecessarily. Closes #389.

Library:
- Fix `mosquitto_topic_matches_sub()` not returning MOSQ_ERR_INVAL for
  invalid subscriptions like `topic/#abc`. This only affects the return value,
  not the match/no match result, which was already correct.

Build:
- Don't require C99 compiler.
- Add rewritten build test script and remove some build warnings.


1.5.6 - 20190206
================

Security:
- CVE-2018-12551: If Mosquitto is configured to use a password file for
  authentication, any malformed data in the password file will be treated as
  valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and no
  password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get access
  to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank line
  will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are
  unaffected. Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create
  and modify their password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.
  Affects version 1.0 to 1.5.5 inclusive.
- CVE-2018-12550: If an ACL file is empty, or has only blank lines or
  comments, then mosquitto treats the ACL file as not being defined, which
  means that no topic access is denied. Although denying access to all topics
  is not a useful configuration, this behaviour is unexpected and could lead
  to access being incorrectly granted in some circumstances. This is now
  fixed. Affects versions 1.0 to 1.5.5 inclusive.
- CVE-2018-12546. If a client publishes a retained message to a topic that
  they have access to, and then their access to that topic is revoked, the
  retained message will still be delivered to future subscribers. This
  behaviour may be undesirable in some applications, so a configuration option
  `check_retain_source` has been introduced to enforce checking of the
  retained message source on publish.

Broker:
- Fixed comment handling for config options that have optional arguments.
- Improved documentation around bridge topic remapping.
- Handle mismatched handshakes (e.g. QoS1 PUBLISH with QoS2 reply) properly.
- Fix spaces not being allowed in the bridge remote_username option. Closes
  #1131.
- Allow broker to always restart on Windows when using `log_dest file`. Closes
  #1080.
- Fix Will not being sent for Websockets clients. Closes #1143.
- Windows: Fix possible crash when client disconnects. Closes #1137.
- Fixed durable clients being unable to receive messages when offline, when
  per_listener_settings was set to true. Closes #1081.
- Add log message for the case where a client is disconnected for sending a
  topic with invalid UTF-8. Closes #1144.

Library:
- Fix TLS connections not working over SOCKS.
- Don't clear SSL context when TLS connection is closed, meaning if a user
  provided an external SSL_CTX they have less chance of leaking references.

Build:
- Fix comparison of boolean values in CMake build. Closes #1101.
- Fix compilation when openssl deprecated APIs are not available.
  Closes #1094.
- Man pages can now be built on any system. Closes #1139.


1.5.5 - 20181211
================

Security:
- If `per_listener_settings` is set to true, then the `acl_file` setting was
  ignored for the "default listener" only. This has been fixed. This does not
  affect any listeners defined with the `listener` option. Closes #1073.
  This is now tracked as CVE-2018-20145.

Broker:
- Add `socket_domain` option to allow listeners to disable IPv6 support.
  This is required to work around a problem in libwebsockets that means
  sockets only listen on IPv6 by default if IPv6 support is compiled in.
  Closes #1004.
- When using ADNS, don't ask for all network protocols when connecting,
  because this can lead to confusing "Protocol not supported" errors if the
  network is down. Closes #1062.
- Fix outgoing retained messages not being sent by bridges on initial
  connection. Closes #1040.
- Don't reload auth_opt_ options on reload, to match the behaviour of the
  other plugin options. Closes #1068.
- Print message on error when installing/uninstalling as a Windows service.
- All non-error connect/disconnect messages are controlled by the
  `connection_messages` option. Closes #772. Closes #613. Closes #537.

Library:
- Fix reconnect delay backoff behaviour. Closes #1027.
- Don't call on_disconnect() twice if keepalive tests fail. Closes #1067.

Client:
- Always print leading zeros in mosquitto_sub when output format is hex.
  Closes #1066.

Build:
- Fix building where TLS-PSK is not available. Closes #68.


1.5.4 - 20181108
================

Security:
- When using a TLS enabled websockets listener with "require_certificate"
  enabled, the mosquitto broker does not correctly verify client certificates.
  This is now fixed. All other security measures operate as expected, and in
  particular non-websockets listeners are not affected by this. Closes #996.

Broker:
- Process all pending messages even when a client has disconnected. This means
  a client that send a PUBLISH then DISCONNECT quickly, then disconnects will
  have its DISCONNECT message processed properly and so no Will will be sent.
  Closes #7.
- $SYS/broker/clients/disconnected should never be negative. Closes #287.
- Give better error message if a client sends a password without a username.
  Closes #1015.
- Fix bridge not honoring restart_timeout. Closes #1019.
- Don't disconnect a client if an auth plugin denies access to SUBSCRIBE.
  Closes #1016.

Library:
- Fix memory leak that occurred if mosquitto_reconnect() was used when TLS
  errors were present. Closes #592.
- Fix TLS connections when using an external event loop with
  mosquitto_loop_read() and mosquitto_write(). Closes #990.

Build:
- Fix clients not being compiled with threading support when using CMake.
  Closes #983.
- Header fixes for FreeBSD. Closes #977.
- Use _GNU_SOURCE to fix build errors in websockets and getaddrinfo usage.
  Closes #862 and #933.
- Fix builds on QNX 7.0.0. Closes #1018.


1.5.3 - 20180925
================

Security:
- Fix CVE-2018-12543. If a message is sent to Mosquitto with a topic that
  begins with $, but is not $SYS, then an assert that should be unreachable is
  triggered and Mosquitto will exit.

Broker:
- Elevate log level to warning for situation when socket limit is hit.
- Remove requirement to use `user root` in snap package config files.
- Fix retained messages not sent by bridges on outgoing topics at the first
  connection. Closes #701.
- Documentation fixes. Closes #520, #600.
- Fix duplicate clients being added to by_id hash before the old client was
  removed. Closes #645.
- Fix Windows version not starting if include_dir did not contain any files.
  Closes #566.
- When an authentication plugin denied access to a SUBSCRIBE, the client would
  be disconnected incorrectly. This has been fixed. Closes #1016.

Build:
- Various fixes to ease building.


1.5.2 - 20180919
================

Broker:
- Fix build when using WITH_ADNS=yes.
- Fix incorrect call to setsockopt() for TCP_NODELAY. Closes #941.

Build:
- Make it easier to build without bundled uthash.h using "WITH_BUNDLED_DEPS=no".
- Fix build with OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE. Closes #932.


1.5.1 - 20180816
================

Broker:
- Fix plugin cleanup function not being called on exit of the broker.
  Closes #900.
- Print more OpenSSL errors when loading certificates/keys fail.
- Use AF_UNSPEC etc. instead of PF_UNSPEC to comply with POSIX. Closes #863.
- Remove use of AI_ADDRCONFIG, which means the broker can be used on systems
  where only the loopback interface is defined. Closes #869, Closes #901.
- Fix IPv6 addresses not being able to be used as bridge addresses.
  Closes #886.
- All clients now time out if they exceed their keepalive*1.5, rather than
  just reach it. This was inconsistent in two places.
- Fix segfault on startup if bridge CA certificates could not be read.
  Closes #851.
- Fix problem opening listeners on Pi caused by unsigned char being default.
  Found via #849.
- ACL patterns that do not contain either %c or %u now produce a warning in
  the log. Closes #209.

  on_disconnect() callback. This has resulted in two new error codes,
  MOSQ_ERR_KEEPALIVE and MOSQ_ERR_LOOKUP.
- Fix connection problems when mosquitto_loop_start() was called before
  mosquitto_connect_async(). Closes #848.

Clients:
- When compiled using WITH_TLS=no, the default port was incorrectly being set
  to -1. This has been fixed.
- Fix compiling on Mac OS X <10.12. Closes #813 and #240.

Build:
- Fixes for building on NetBSD. Closes #258.
- Fixes for building on FreeBSD.
- Add support for compiling with static libwebsockets library.


1.5 - 20180502
==============

Security:
- Fix memory leak that could be caused by a malicious CONNECT packet. This
  does not yet have a CVE assigned. Closes #533493 (on Eclipse bugtracker)

Broker features:
- Add per_listener_settings to allow authentication and access control to be
  per listener.
- Add limited support for reloading listener settings. This allows settings
  for an already defined listener to be reloaded, but port numbers must not be
  changed.
- Add ability to deny access to SUBSCRIBE messages as well as the current
  read/write accesses. Currently for auth plugins only.
- Reduce calls to malloc through the use of UHPA.
- Outgoing messages with QoS>1 are no longer retried after a timeout period.
  Messages will be retried when a client reconnects.  This change in behaviour
  can be justified by considering when the timeout may have occurred.
  * If a connection is unreliable and has dropped, but without one end
    noticing, the messages will be retried on reconnection. Sending
    additional PUBLISH or PUBREL would not have changed anything.
  * If a client is overloaded/unable to respond/has a slow connection then
    sending additional PUBLISH or PUBREL would not help the client catch
    up. Once the backlog has cleared the client will respond. If it is not
    able to catch up, sending additional duplicates would not help either.
- Add use_subject_as_username option for certificate based client
  authentication to use the entire certificate subject as a username, rather
  than just the CN. Closes #469467.
- Change sys tree printing output. This format shouldn't be relied upon and
  may change at any time. Closes #470246.
- Minimum supported libwebsockets version is now 1.3.
- Add systemd startup notification and services. Closes #471053.
- Reduce unnecessary malloc and memcpy when receiving a message and storing
  it. Closes #470258.
- Support for Windows XP has been dropped.
- Bridge connections now default to using MQTT v3.1.1.
- mosquitto_db_dump tool can now output some stats on clients.
- Perform utf-8 validation on incoming will, subscription and unsubscription
  topics.
- new $SYS/broker/store/messages/count (deprecates $SYS/broker/messages/stored)
- new $SYS/broker/store/messages/bytes
- max_queued_bytes feature to limit queues by real size rather than
  than just message count. Closes Eclipse #452919 or Github #100
- Add support for bridges to be configured to only send notifications to the
  local broker.
- Add set_tcp_nodelay option to allow Nagle's algorithm to be disabled on
  client sockets. Closes #433.
- The behaviour of allow_anonymous has changed. In the old behaviour, the
  default if not set was to allow anonymous access. The new behaviour is to
  default is to allow anonymous access unless another security option is set.
  For example, if password_file is set and allow_anonymous is not set, then
  anonymous access will be denied. It is still possible to allow anonymous
  access by setting it explicitly.

Broker fixes:
- Fix UNSUBSCRIBE with no topic is accepted on MQTT 3.1.1. Closes #665.
- Produce an error if two bridges share the same local_clientid.
- Miscellaneous fixes on Windows.
- queue_qos0_messages was not observing max_queued_** limits
- When using the include_dir configuration option sort the files
  alphabetically before loading them.  Closes #17.
- IPv6 is no longer disabled for websockets listeners.
- Remove all build timestamp information including $SYS/broker/timestamp.
  Close #651.
- Correctly handle incoming strings that contain a NULL byte. Closes #693.

1.4.15 - 20180228
=================

Security:
- Fix CVE-2017-7652. If a SIGHUP is sent to the broker when there are no more
  file descriptors, then opening the configuration file will fail and security
  settings will be set back to their default values.
- Fix CVE-2017-7651. Unauthenticated clients can cause excessive memory use by
  setting "remaining length" to be a large value. This is now mitigated by
  limiting the size of remaining length to valid values. A "memory_limit"
  configuration option has also been added to allow the overall memory used by
  the broker to be limited.

Broker:
- Use constant time memcmp for password comparisons.
- Fix incorrect PSK key being used if it had leading zeroes.
- Fix memory leak if a client provided a username/password for a listener with
  use_identity_as_username configured.

1.4.13 - 20170627
=================

Security:
- Fix CVE-2017-9868. The persistence file was readable by all local users,
  potentially allowing sensitive information to be leaked.
  This can also be fixed administratively, by restricting access to the
  directory in which the persistence file is stored.

Broker:
- Fix for poor websockets performance.
- Fix lazy bridges not timing out for idle_timeout. Closes #417.
- Fix problems with large retained messages over websockets. Closes #427.

  usernames/client ids with the auth_plugin_deny_special_chars option.
  Partially closes #462.
- Restrictions for CVE-2017-7650 have been relaxed - '/' is allowed in
  usernames/client ids. Remainder of fix for #462.

Clients:
- Don't use / in auto-generated client ids.


1.4.12 - 20170528
=================

Security:
- Fix CVE-2017-7650, which allows clients with username or client id set to
  '#' or '+' to bypass pattern based ACLs or third party plugins. The fix
  denies message sending or receiving of messages for clients with a '#' or
  '+' in their username or client id and if the message is subject to a
  pattern ACL check or plugin check.
  Patches for other versions are available at

1.4 - 20150218
==============

Important changes:
- Websockets support in the broker.
- Bridge behaviour on the local broker has changed due to the introduction of
  the local_* options. This may affect you if you are using authentication
  and/or ACLs with bridges.
- The default TLS behaviour has changed to accept all of TLS v1.2, v1.1 and
  v1.0, rather than only only one version of the protocol. It is still
  possible to restrict a listener to a single version of TLS.
- The Python client has been removed now that the Eclipse Paho Python client
  has had a release.
- When a durable client reconnects, its queued messages are now checked
  against ACLs in case of a change in username/ACL state since it last
  connected.
- New use_username_as_clientid option on the broker, for preventing hijacking
  of a client id.
- The client library and clients now have experimental SOCKS5 support.
- Wildcard TLS certificates are now supported for bridges and clients.
- The clients have support for config files with default options.
- Client and client libraries have support for MQTT v3.1.1.
- Bridge support for MQTT v3.1.1.


Broker:
- Websockets support in the broker.
- Add local_clientid, local_username, local_password for bridge connections to
  authenticate to the local broker.
- Default TLS mode now accepts TLS v1.2, v1.1 and v1.0.
- Support for ECDHE-ECDSA family ciphers.
- Fix bug #1324411, which could have had unexpected consequences for delayed
  messages in rare circumstances.
- Add support for "session present" in CONNACK messages for MQTT v3.1.1.
- Remove strict protocol #ifdefs.
- Change $SYS/broker/clients/active -> $SYS/broker/clients/connected
- Change $SYS/broker/clients/inactive -> $SYS/broker/clients/disconnected
- When a durable client reconnects, its queued messages are now checked
  against ACLs in case of a change in username/ACL state since it last
  connected.
- libuuid is used to generate client ids, where it is available, when an MQTT
  v3.1.1 client connects with a zero length client id.
- Anonymous clients are no longer accidently disconnected from the broker
  after a SIGHUP.
- mosquitto_passwd now supports -b (batch mode) to allow the password to be
  provided at the command line.
- Removed $SYS/broker/changeset. This was intended for use with debugging, but
  in practice is of no use.
- Add support for use_username_as_clientid which can be used with
  authentication to restrict ownership of client ids and hence prevent one
  client disconnecting another by using the same client id.
- When "require_certificate" was false, the broker was incorrectly asking for
  a certificate (but not checking it). This caused problems with some clients
  and has been fixed so the broker no longer asks.
- When using syslog logging on non-Windows OSs, it is now possible to specify
  the logging facility to one of local0-7 instead of the default "daemon".
- The bridge_attempt_unsubscribe option has been added, to allow the sending
  of UNSUBSCRIBE requests to be disabled for topics with "out" direction.
  Closes bug #456899.
- Wildcard TLS certificates are now supported for bridges.
- Support for "hour" client expiration lengths for the
  persistent_client_expiration option. Closes bug #425835.
- Bridge support for MQTT v3.1.1.
- Root privileges are now dropped after starting listeners and loading
  certificates/private keys, to allow private keys to have their permissions
  restricted to the root user only. Closes bug #452914.
- Usernames and topics given in ACL files can now include a space. Closes bug
  #431780.
- Fix hang if pattern acl contains a %u but an anonymous client connect.
  Closes bug #455402.
- Fix man page installation with cmake. Closes bug #458843.
- When using "log_dest file" the output file is now flushed periodically.

Clients:
- Both clients can now load default configuration options from a file.
- Add -C option to mosquitto_sub to allow the client to quit after receiving a
  certain count of messages. Closes bug #453850.

- Pub client supports setting its keepalive. Closes bug #454852.
- Add support for config files with default options.
- Add support for MQTT v3.1.1.

Client library:
- Add experimental SOCKS5 support.
- mosquitto_loop_forever now quits after a fatal error, rather than blindly
  retrying.

- mosquittopp now has a virtual destructor. Closes bug #452915.
- Add support for MQTT v3.1.1.
- Don't quit mosquitto_loop_forever() if broker not available on first
  connect. Closes bug #453293, but requires more work.

================

Broker:
- Fix possible memory leak when using a topic that has a leading slash. Fixes
  bug #1360985.
- Fix saving persistent database on Windows.
- Temporarily disable ACL checks on subscriptions when using MQTT v3.1.1. This
  is due to the complexity of checking wildcard ACLs against wildcard
  subscriptions. This does not have a negative impact on security because
  checks are still made before a message is sent to a client.
  Fixes bug #1374291.
- When using -v and the broker receives a SIGHUP, verbose logging was being
  disabled. This has been fixed.

Client library:
- Fix mutex being incorrectly passed by value. Fixes bug #1373785.

1.3.4 - 20140806
================

Broker:
- Don't ask client for certificate when require_certificate is false.

  clients that connect without a username.
- Fix subscriptions being deleted when clients subscribed to a topic beginning
  with a $ but that is not $SYS.
- When a durable client reconnects, its queued messages are now checked
  against ACLs in case of a change in username/ACL state since it last
  connected.

  messages in rare circumstances.
- Anonymous clients are no longer accidently disconnected from the broker
  after a SIGHUP.

General:
- Use $(STRIP) for stripping binaries when installing, to allow easier cross
  compilation.

1.3.1 - 20140324
================

Broker:
- Prevent possible crash on client reconnect. Closes bug #1294108.
- Don't accept zero length unsubscription strings (MQTT v3.1.1 fix)

- Don't disconnect clients immediately on HUP to give chance for all data to
  be read.
- Reject invalid un/subscriptions e.g. foo/+bar #/bar.
- Take more care not to disconnect clients that are sending large messages.

Client library:
- Fix socketpair code on the Mac.

1.3 - 20140316
==============

Broker:
- The broker no longer ignores the auth_plugin_init() return value.
- Accept SSLv2/SSLv3 HELLOs when using TLSv1, whilst keeping SSLv2 and SSLv3
  disabled. This increases client compatibility without sacrificing security.
- The $SYS tree can now be disabled at runtime as well as at compile time.
- When remapping bridged topics, only check for matches when the message
  direction is correct. This allows two identical topics to be remapped
  differently for both in and out.
- Change "$SYS/broker/heap/current size" to "$SYS/broker/heap/current" for
  easier parsing.
- Change "$SYS/broker/heap/maximum size" to "$SYS/broker/heap/maximum" for
  easier parsing.
- Topics are no longer normalised from e.g a///topic to a/topic. This matches
  the behaviour as clarified by the Oasis MQTT spec. This will lead to
  unexpected behaviour if you were using topics of this form.
- Log when outgoing messages for a client begin to drop off the end of the
  queue.
- Bridge clients are recognised as bridges even after reloading from
  persistence.
- Basic support for MQTT v3.1.1. This does not include being able to bridge to
  an MQTT v3.1.1 broker.
- Username is displayed in log if present when a client connects.
- Support for 0 length client ids (v3.1.1 only) that result in automatically
  generated client ids on the broker (see option allow_zero_length_clientid).
- Ability to set the prefix of automatically generated client ids (see option
  auto_id_prefix).
- Add support for TLS session resumption.
- When using TLS, the server now chooses the cipher to use when negotiating
  with the client.
- Weak TLS ciphers are now disabled by default.

Client library:
- Fix support for Python 2.6, 3.0, 3.1.
- Add support for un/subscribing to multiple topics at once in un/subscribe().
- Clients now close their socket after sending DISCONNECT.
- Python client now contains its version number.
- C library mosquitto_want_write() now supports TLS clients.
- Fix possible memory leak in C/C++ library when communicating with
  a broker that doesn't follow the spec.
- Return strerror() through mosquitto_strerror() to make error printing
  easier.
- Topics are no longer normalised from e.g a///topic to a/topic. This matches
  the behaviour as clarified by the Oasis MQTT spec. This will lead to
  unexpected behaviour if you were using topics of this form.
- Add support for SRV lookups.
- Break out of select() on publish(), subscribe() etc. when using the threaded
  interface. Fixes bug #1270062.
- Handle incoming and outgoing messages separately. Fixes bug #1263172.

  makes using them in a separate event loop more straightforward.
- Add mosquitto_loop_forever() / loop_forever() function call to make simple
  clients easier.
- Disable SSL compression. This reduces memory usage significantly and removes
  the possibility of CRIME type attacks.

0.10.2 - 20110106
=================

- Don't abort when connecting if the first connection fails. This is important
  on e.g. Windows 7, where IPV6 is offered as the first choice but may not be
  available.
- Deal with long logging messages properly (bug #785882).
- Fix library compilation on Symbian - no pselect() available.
- Don't stop processing subscriptions on received messages after a
  subscription with # matches. (bug #791206).

0.10.1 - 20110512
=================

- Fix Windows compilation.
- Fix mosquitto.py on Windows - call lib init/cleanup.
- Don't abort when connecting if given an unknown address type (assuming an
  IPv4 or IPv6 address is given).

0.10 - 20110429
===============

- Implement support for the password_file option and accompanying
  authentication requirements in the broker.
- Implement topic Access Control Lists.
- mosquitto_will_set() and mosquitto_publish() now return
  MOSQ_ERR_PAYLOAD_SIZE if the payload is too large (>268,435,455 bytes).
- Bridge support can now be disabled at compile time.
- Group together network writes for outgoing packets - don't send single byte
  writes!
- Add support for clientid_prefixes variable.
- Add support for the clientid config variable for controlling bridge client
  ids.
- Remove 32-bit database ID support because htobe64() no longer used.
- Multiple client subscriptions to the same topic result in only a single
  subscription. Bug #744077.

0.9.3 - 20110310
================

- Set retained message status for QoS 2 messages (bug #726535).
- Only abort with an error when opening listening sockets if no address family
  is available, rather than aborting when any address family is not available.
- Don't clean queued messages when a non clean session client reconnects.
- Make mosquitto.py compatible with Python <2.6.
- Fix mosquitto.h header includes for Windows.

0.9.2 - 20110208
================

- Only send a single DISCONNECT command when using -l in the pub client.
- Set QoS=1 on PUBREL commands to meet protocol spec.
- Don't leak sockets on connection failure in the library.
- Install man pages when building under cmake.
- Fix crash bug on malformed CONNECT message.
- Clients are now rejected if their socket peer name cannot be obtained on
  connection.
- Fix a number of potential problems caused when a client with a duplicate id
  connects.

0.9.1 - 20101203
================

- Add missing code for parsing the "bind_address" configuration option.
- Fix missing include when compiling with tcp-wrappers support.
- Add linker version script for C library to control exported functions.

0.9 - 20101114
==============

- Client and message data is now stored in memory with custom routines rather
  than a sqlite database. This removes the dependencies on sqlite, pcre and
  sqlite3-pcre. It also means that the persistent database format has had to
  be reimplemented in a custom format. Optional support for importing old
  sqlite databases is provided.
- Added IPv6 support for mosquitto and the clients.
- Provide username and password support for the clients and client libraries.
  This is part of the new MQTT v3.1 spec.
- The broker supports the username and password connection flags, but will not
  do anything with the username and password.
- Python callback functions now optionally take an extra argument which will
  return the user object passed to the Mosquitto() constructor, or the calling
  python object itself if nothing was given to Mosquitto().
- Remove the mosquitto command line option "-i interface".
- Remove the mosquitto.conf "interface" variable.
- Add support for the listener config variable (replaces the interface
  variable)
- Add support for the bind_address config variable.
- Change the port config variable behaviour to match that of rsmb (applies to
  the default listener only, can be given just once).
- Fix QoS 2 protocol compliance - stop sending duplicate messages and handle
  timeouts correctly. Fixes bug #598290.
- Set retain flag correctly for outgoing messages. It should only be set for
  messages sent in response to a subscribe command (ie. stale data).
- Fix bug in returning correct CONNACK result to on_connect client callback.
- Don't send client will if it is disconnected for exceeding its keepalive
  timer.
- Fix client library unsubscribe function incorrectly sending a SUBSCRIBE
  command when it should be UNSUBSCRIBE.
- Fix max_inflight_messages and max_queued_messages operation. These
  parameters now apply only to QoS 1 and 2 messages and are used regardless of
  the client connection state.
- mosquitto.conf now installed to /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf instead of
  /etc/mosquitto.conf. The /etc/mosquitto/ directory will be used for password
  and access control files in the future.
- Give the compile time option of using 32-bit integers for the database IDs
  instead of 64-bit integers. This is useful where htobe64()/be64toh() are not
  available or for embedded systems for example.
- The DUP bit is now set correctly when resending PUBREL messages.
- A port to Windows native has been partially completed. This currently drops a
  number of features, including the ability to change configuration parameters
  and persistent storage.

0.8.3 - 20101004
================

- Fix QoS 2 protocol compliance - stop sending duplicate messages and handle
  timeouts correctly. Fixes bug #598290. (backported from future 0.9 code)

0.8.2 - 20100815
================

- Fix default loop() timeout value in mosquitto.py. Previous value was 0,
  causing high cpu load.
- Fix message handling problem in client library when more than one message was
  in the client queue.
- Fix the logic used to determine whether a QoS>0 message needs to be retried.
- Fix the Python sub.py example so that it quits on error.

0.8.1 - 20100812
================

- Improve python interface
- Fix incorrect return value from message delete function
- Use logging function to print error messages in clients.
- Fix python installation script DESTDIR.
- Fix library destination path for 64-bit machines.

0.8 - 20100807
==============

- Topics starting with a / are treated as distinct to those not starting with
  a /. For example, /topic/path is different to topic/path. This matches the
  behaviour of rsmb.
- Correctly calculate the will QoS on a new client connection (bug #597451).
- Add "addresses" configuration file variable as an alias of "address", for
  better rsmb compatibility.
- Bridge clean_session setting is now false, to give more sensible behaviour
  and be more compatible with rsmb.
- Add cleansession variable for configuring bridges.
- Add keepalive_interval variable for bridges.
- Remove default topic subscription for mosquitto_sub because the old
  behaviour was too confusing.
- Added a C client library, which the pub and sub clients now use.
- Added a C++ client library (bound to the C library).
- Added a Python client library (bound to the C library).
- Added CMake build scripts to allow the library and clients (not the broker)
  to be compiled natively on Windows.

0.7 - 20100615
==============

- mosquitto_pub can now send null (zero length) messages.
- Don't store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients with subscriptions of
  QoS>0.
- accept() all available sockets when new clients are connecting, rather than
  just one.
- Add option to print debug messages in pub and sub clients.
- hg revision is now exported via $SYS/broker/changeset
- Send Will when client exceeds keepalive timer and is disconnected.
- Check to see if a client has a will before sending it.
- Correctly deal with clients connecting with the same id multiple times.
- Add compile time option to disable heap memory tracking.
- Use poll() instead of select() to allow >1024 clients.
- Implement max_connections.
- Run VACUUM on in-memory database on receiving SIGUSR2.
- Fix bridge keepalive timeouts and reconnects.
- Don't attempt to drop root privileges when running on Windows as this isn't
  well supported (bug #586231).

0.6.1 - 20100506
================

- Fix DB auto upgrade for messages table.

0.6 - 20100505
==============

- Basic support for connecting multiple MQTT brokers together (bridging).
- mosquitto_sub can now subscribe to multiple topics (limited to a global QoS).
- mosquitto_pub can now send a file as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read all of stdin and send it as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read stdin and send each line as a message.
- mosquitto will now correctly run VACUUM on the persistent database on exit.
- Implement a more efficient database design, so that only one copy of each
  message is held in the database, rather than one per subscribed client.
- Add the store_cleanup_interval config option for dealing with the internal
  message store.
- Add support for disabling "clean session" for the sub client.
- Add support for automatic upgrading of the mosquitto DB from v1 to v2.
- Add persistence_file config option to allow changing the filename of the
  persistence database. This allows multiple mosquitto DBs to be stored in the
  same location whilst keeping persistence_location compatible with rsmb.
- Don't store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients. Fixes bug #572608. This
  wasn't correctly fixed in version 0.5.
- Don't disconnect clients if they send a PUBLISH with zero length payload
  (bug #573610).
- If a retained message is received with a zero length payload, the retained
  message for that topic is deleted.
- Send through zero length messages.
- Produce a warning on unsupported rsmb options instead of quitting.
- Describe clean session flag in the mqtt man page.
- Implement the max_inflight_messages and max_queued_messages features in the
  broker.

0.5.4 - 20100311
================

- Fix memory allocation in mqtt3_fix_sub_topic() (bug #531861).
- Remove accidental limit of 100 client connections.
- Fix mosquitto_pub handling of messages with QoS>0 (bug #537061).

0.5.3 - 20100303
================

- Will messages are now only sent when a client disconnects unexpectedly.
- Fix all incoming topics/subscriptions that start with a / or contain
  multiple / in a row (//).
- Do actually disconnect client when it sends an empty subscription/topic string.
- Add missing $SYS/broker/clients/total to man page.

0.5.2 - 20100302
================

- Always update last backup time, so that the backup doesn't run every time
  through the main loop once autosave_interval has been reached.
- Report $SYS/broker/uptime in the same format as rsmb.
- Make mandatory options obvious in usage output and man page of mosquitto_pub.
  Fixes bug #529990.
- Treat subscriptions with a trailing slash correctly. This should fix bugs
  #530369 and #530099.

0.5.1 - 20100227
================

- Must daemonise before pid file is written.

0.5 - 20100227
==============

- No longer store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients that do not have
  clean start set.
- Rename msg_timeout option to retry_interval for better rsmb compatibility.
- Change persistence behaviour. The database is now stored in memory even if
  persistence is enabled. It is written to disk when mosquitto exits and also at
  periodic intervals as defined by the new autosave_interval option.
- The writing of the persistence database may be forced by sending mosquitto
  the SIGUSR1 signal.
- Clients that do not send CONNECT as their first command are now
  disconnected.
- Boolean configuration values may now be specified with true/false as well as
  1/0.
- Log message on CONNECT with invalid protocol or protocol version.
- Default sqlite3-pcre path on Linux is now /usr/lib/sqlite3/pcre.so to match
  future sqlite3-pcre packages.
- Add mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub, simple clients for subscribe/publish.
- Add man pages for clients.
- Add general man page on mqtt.
- Root privileges are now dropped only after attempting to write a pid file
  (if configured). This means that the pid file can be written to /var/run/
  directly and should fix bug #523183.

0.4.2 - 20100203
================

- Fix segfault on client connect with invalid protocol name/version.

0.4.1 - 20100112
===============

- Fix regex used for finding retained messages to send on new subscription.

0.4 - 20100105
==============

- Added support for wildcard subscriptions using + and #.
- All network operations are now non-blocking and can cope with partial
  packets, meaning that networking should be a lot more reliable.
- Total messsages/bytes sent/received are now available in $SYS.
- Improved logging information - use client ip address and id instead of
  socket number.
- Broker build timestamp is available in $SYS.
- Keepalive==0 is now correctly treated as "never disconnect".
- Fixed manpage installation.
- Fixed incorrect $SYS hierarchy locations in documentation and code.
- Debug type log messages are no longer sent to "topics".
- Default logging destination no longer includes "topics" to prevent possible
  error logging to the db before it is initialised.
- Periodic $SYS messages can now be disabled.
- stdout and stderr are flushed when logging to them to give more timely
  updates.
- dup is now set correctly when resending messages.
- Database format bumped due to topic column naming fix.

0.3 - 20091217
==============

- The port option in the configuration file and --port command line argument
  may now be given any number of times to make mosquitto listen on multiple
  sockets.
- Add new config file and command line option "interface" to specify an
  interface to listen on, rather than all interfaces.
- Added host access control through tcp-wrappers support.
- Set SO_REUSEADDR on the listening socket so restart is much quicker.
- Added support for tracking current heap memory usage - this is published on
  the topic "$SYS/broker/heap/current size"
- Added code for logging to stderr, stdout, syslog and topics.
- Added logging to numerous places - still plenty of scope for more.

0.2 - 20091204
==============

- Replaced the command line option --foreground with --daemon, swapping the
  default behaviour.
- Added the command line option --config-file, to specify a config file to
  load.  If this is not given, no config file is load and the default options
  are used.
- Added the command line option --port for specifying the port to listen on.
  This overrides values in the config file.
- Don't use persistence by default.
- Default behaviour is now more sane when run by a normal user with no command
  line options (combination of above changes).
- Added option user to config file, defaulting to a value of mosquitto. If
  this value isn't blank and mosquitto is started by root, then it will drop
  privileges by changing to the user and its primary group. This replaces the
  current behaviour of refusing to start if run by root.
- Fix non-persistent mode, which would never work in the previous release.
- Added information on default values of msg_timeout and sys_interval to the
  mosquitto.conf man page. (closes bug #492045).
